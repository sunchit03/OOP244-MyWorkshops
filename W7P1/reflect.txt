Workshop-7
This workshop introduced the new concept of Inheritance. The topic was very well
explained during the lecture by the professor so I did not face any sort of issue
while doing this workshop.
It did not take much time to complete this workshop because the methods of the two
classes (parent- VehicleBasic and child- Dumper) were very similar in their
implementation (for example - write, read, >> and << operators), and the child 
class was to use some of the parent's class' methods to get the desired output.


Milestone-1 & Milestone-2
The first and the second part of the milestone revisited the concept of 
constructors. In these milestone, I learnt about a new thing - enforcing that the 
classes cannot be copied or assigned using the delete keyword in the particular 
prototypes.
In the milestone-2, I faced one issue while writing the code. I did not know how to
initialize the parking and vehicle Menu objects, I tried to call the Menu 
constructor, but it gave me compiling errors.
So, I initialized the objects right at the time of the declaration, and it
worked without giving any errors.
