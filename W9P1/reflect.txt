Workshop-9
In this workshop, we were to implement the rule of 3 in both the base as well as the
derived class and to make sure there was no memory leak while doing so. I took
reference from the code that the professor had written to demonstrate successful
copying and assignment. Out of the three methods shown by the professor, I chose the
one where the copy constructor and assignment operators of the base class were 
called in the respective methods of the derived class.
While submitting the workshop, I faced some issues on matrix - 
The first was that the ouput was slightly different on visual studio and matrix.
The second error was a memory leak.
I managed to solve the first issue, and for the second one I used valgrind to trace 
the error which said that it was being caused by an unitialized value. It was an 
off by one error.

Milestone-4
In this milestone, we have created two new classes - Car and Motorcycle, derived 
from the Vehicles class. Both these classes had very similar functions which helped
in completing the workshop quickly.
Similar to the workshop-9, the rule of 3 was to be applied in the base and derived 
classes. So, I applied the same method for this one as well.
