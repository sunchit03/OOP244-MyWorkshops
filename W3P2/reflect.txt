This workshop introduced the concept of classes to us. Their usage is very similar
to structures, with the difference being of the accessibility of its members. 
Initially, I was confused as to how the members could be private or public, and 
while working on the workshop, I did face a slight trouble trying to access the 
private members of the class, but eventually I was able to understand the usage.
 
Another difficulty I faced was in the formatting of the output, specifically how 
to justify the string or the number to the left or right side. When I first did 
the lab part of the workshop, I used printf but I knew it wasn't the right 
approach. I tried to find the solution online, which suggested me to use the 
setw function (part of the iomanip library). That did give me the desired output,
but I was not sure if we were allowed to use another library.
Luckily, the professor discussed how to go about it in the workshop overview, 
which helped me in completing the workshop.
