The lab part of the workshop was primarily based on the usage of constructors
and destructors. The professor had explained the difference between constructors
and functions really well, how the constructors call the functions and not
vice-versa. The lab part also introduced the logic of using reference of objects
such as classes or even the istream and ostream. And by this way, their use can
be maximised.
Using the concepts learnt during the lectures and the lab helped putting things
together for the DIY part of the workshop. Initially, I found the DIY workshop
a bit confusing. I could not understand this line in particular -
	t = new TourBus(num);
because t is an instance of the class and the allocation was of non-array type.
But then looking through the lectures codes, I found a similar code and
understood that this could be done with the use of a constructor with int type
parameter.
	TourBus::TourBus(int value) {
      	m_size = value;
   	}
The remaining of the workshop was easier to build on.
