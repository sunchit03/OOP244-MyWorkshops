This workshop broadened my understanding of the topic of dynamic allocation and
deallocation. I found this workshop easier than the first one. I was able to quickly proceed
through the functions, but there were a few things which kept me scratching my
head. In order to successfully display the records and then deallocate them, I
needed the total number of records, but I could not use the noOfRecords() function
because the display() and deallocateMemory() functions do not have access to
the file. Initially I hard-coded the value inorder to move on with the workshop.
I wanted to somewhat globalize the total number of records so that I could
use it in the display and deallocate functions. I did come up with a solution - of 
creating a struct just to store the total number of records - but I do not think
that it is the right way to do so. 

struct Counter {
      int recordsCnt;
   };

But, I couldn't think of any other way so I
moved on with it. Then, while checking the feedback on matrix, it kept showing
that there were memory leaks, I realised that I had missed the fclose function.
